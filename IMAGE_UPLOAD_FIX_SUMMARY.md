# Image Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Upload Error for Rooms
**Problem**: The frontend was calling `/api/upload/images` endpoint which didn't exist in the backend.

**Solution**: 
- Created a dedicated image upload endpoint at `/api/properties/upload/images` in the backend
- Updated frontend calls to use the correct endpoint path
- Fixed both property images and room-specific image uploads

### 2. Backend Endpoints Created
**New Endpoints Added**:
- `POST /api/properties/upload/images` - For uploading property and room images
- `POST /api/payments/mtn-mobile-money` - For MTN Mobile Money payments
- `GET /api/payments/status/:transactionId` - For checking payment status
- `POST /api/billing/rra-ebm` - For RRA EBM bill generation
- `GET /api/billing/bill/:billId` - For retrieving bill details
- `POST /api/billing/verify/:billId` - For verifying bills with RRA

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. `backend/src/routes/properties.js` - Added image upload endpoint
2. `backend/src/routes/payments.js` - Created new file for payment processing
3. `backend/src/routes/billing.js` - Created new file for RRA EBM integration
4. `backend/src/server.js` - Added new route handlers

### Frontend Files:
1. `frontend/src/pages/EnhancedUploadProperty.jsx` - Fixed API endpoint URLs

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Frontend Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Image Upload
1. Navigate to the property upload page
2. Try uploading images for both property and individual rooms
3. Verify images are uploaded successfully without errors

### 4. Test MTN Mobile Money Payment
1. Navigate to the MTN Mobile Money payment page
2. Fill in the payment form with valid Rwanda phone number
3. Submit payment and verify it processes without errors

### 5. Test RRA EBM Integration
1. Navigate to the RRA EBM integration page
2. Fill in customer details with valid TIN number
3. Generate bill and verify it creates successfully

## Key Features

### Image Upload:
- Supports multiple image uploads (up to 10 images)
- Works for both property images and room-specific images
- Proper error handling and validation
- Secure file storage with unique filenames

### MTN Mobile Money:
- Rwanda phone number validation
- Amount validation
- Mock payment processing (ready for real API integration)
- Transaction ID generation
- Payment status tracking

### RRA EBM Integration:
- TIN number validation (10 digits)
- Automatic tax calculation (18% VAT)
- Invoice number generation
- Bill ID generation
- Mock RRA integration (ready for real API integration)

## Notes

- All endpoints include proper authentication
- Error handling is implemented throughout
- The payment and billing systems are currently using mock responses
- Real API integration can be added later by replacing the mock responses
- All validation follows Rwanda's standards (phone numbers, TIN format, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Test the functionality thoroughly
2. Integrate with real MTN Mobile Money API when ready
3. Integrate with real RRA EBM system when ready
4. Add more comprehensive error handling if needed
5. Add logging for debugging purposes
