# Flight Commission Level Upgrade Guide

## Overview
Flight owners can upgrade the commission level for their individual flight bookings to potentially get better visibility and different commission rates. This guide explains how to upgrade commission levels for your flights.

## How to Upgrade Commission Level

### Step 1: Access Your Flights Dashboard
1. Log in to your account as a flight owner/host
2. Navigate to **Flights Dashboard** (`/owner/flights`)
3. Go to the **Bookings** tab

### Step 2: Find the Flight Booking
1. In the bookings table, locate the flight booking you want to upgrade
2. Look for the **Actions** column on the right side of the table

### Step 3: Click the Upgrade Button
1. Click the **crown icon** (👑) in the Actions column for your flight booking
2. This will open the **Commission Upgrade Modal**

### Step 4: Select a New Commission Level
1. In the modal, you'll see:
   - **Current Level**: Your current commission level (if any)
   - **Available Levels**: List of all available commission levels for flights
2. Review each level's details:
   - **Name**: The level name (e.g., "Standard", "Premium", "Featured")
   - **Online Rate**: Commission percentage for online bookings
   - **Direct Rate**: Commission percentage for direct bookings
   - **Premium Badge**: Some levels may have a premium indicator
3. Click on a level to select it (it will be highlighted in blue)
4. Review the upgrade summary showing:
   - New commission rates
   - Estimated commission amount based on your booking price

### Step 5: Confirm the Upgrade
1. Click the **"Upgrade Commission Level"** button
2. Wait for the confirmation message
3. The booking will be updated with the new commission level
4. Commission amount will be recalculated based on:
   - Your booking price
   - The selected commission level
   - Your booking channel (online or direct)

## Important Notes

### Commission Calculation
- **Online Bookings**: Uses the `onlineRate` from the selected commission level
- **Direct Bookings**: Uses the `directRate` from the selected commission level
- **Formula**: `Commission Amount = Booking Price × (Commission Rate / 100)`

### When to Upgrade
- Upgrade when you want better visibility for your flights
- Upgrade to access premium features (if available)
- Upgrade to potentially get different commission rates
- Note: Upgrading may increase or decrease your commission rate depending on the level

### What Gets Tracked
All commission upgrades are automatically logged and tracked by the admin:
- Who performed the upgrade (your account)
- What flight booking was upgraded
- Old commission level and rates
- New commission level and rates
- Timestamp of the upgrade
- IP address and user agent (for security)

### Limitations
- You can only upgrade flights that you own
- Commission levels must be active and available
- The upgrade applies only to that specific flight booking
- Future bookings will use the default commission level unless you upgrade them too

## Admin Tracking

All commission upgrades are automatically tracked in the admin dashboard:
- **Who**: Which owner performed the upgrade
- **What**: Which flight booking was upgraded
- **When**: Timestamp of the upgrade
- **From/To**: Old and new commission levels
- **Impact**: Commission rate and amount changes

Admins can view:
- All commission upgrade history
- Statistics by flight type, level, and date range
- Recent upgrades
- Upgrade trends

## Troubleshooting

### "No commission levels available"
- Contact admin to ensure commission levels are set up for flights
- Check that at least one commission level is active

### "Failed to upgrade commission level"
- Ensure you're the owner of the flight booking
- Check that the selected commission level is active
- Try refreshing the page and attempting again
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Commission amount not updating
- The commission is recalculated automatically
- Refresh the bookings list to see updated amounts
- Check that the booking channel (online/direct) matches your expectation
